 - Examine and codify an organizationâ€™s **security policy**
 - Conduct **Risk Assessment**
 - **Identify sensitive assets**
 - Determine which **significant security incidents** the team should focus on
 - Establish a **Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)**
-   Ensure  your employees are **properly trained**  regarding their **incident response roles and responsibilities** in the event of data breach
-   Develop **incident response drill scenarios** and regularly conduct mock data breaches to **evaluate your incident response plan**.
-   Ensure that all aspects of your incident response plan (training, execution, hardware and software resources, etc.) are **approved and funded** in advance
