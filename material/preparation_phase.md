 - Establish a **Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)**
-   Ensure  your employees are **properly trained**  regarding their **incident response roles and responsibilities** in the event of data breach
-   Develop **incident response drill scenarios** and regularly conduct mock data breaches to **evaluate your incident response plan**.
