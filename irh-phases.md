### 1. Preparation

This phase will be the work horse of your incident response planning, and in the end, the most crucial phase to protect your business. Part of this phase includes:  

-   Ensure  your employees are **properly trained**  regarding their incident response roles and responsibilities in the event of data breach
-   Develop **incident response drill scenarios** and regularly conduct mock data breaches to evaluate your incident response plan.
-   Ensure that all aspects of your incident response plan (training, execution, hardware and software resources, etc.) are **approved and funded** in advance
